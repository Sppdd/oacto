# Demo Script: Chrome AI + n8n Integration

---

Hi! I'm excited to introduce you to Chrome Workflows, a Chrome extension that brings automation to a whole new level by connecting n8n with Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI.

While most automation tools require you to choose between powerful workflows or intelligent AI capabilities, we're combining both in your browser. Chrome Workflows leverages Chrome's native AI APIs to give your n8n automations real intelligence without servers, without data collection, just private, local AI processing.

Let me show you how it works.

Our interface is intentionally clean and simple—you right-click anywhere on the web to trigger your workflows. We provide seven powerful AI nodes powered by Gemini Nano: Prompt AI for conversations, Writer for content creation, Summarizer for quick insights, Translator for multilingual support, Rewriter for tone adjustment, Proofreader for quality checks, and Language Detector for smart routing.

Let's try it on this article. Notice how the workflow triggers instantly, and the AI processes your content right here in Chrome. We're not sending anything to external servers—everything happens locally using Chrome's built-in capabilities.

Chrome Workflows also includes essential customization: manage multiple workflows from our dashboard, test AI functions with the built-in web app, configure origin trial tokens for advanced features, and toggle between different AI modes based on your needs.

I created Chrome Workflows because I believe automation should be intelligent, accessible, and private. By leveraging Chrome's built-in AI alongside n8n's powerful workflow engine, we're giving you sophisticated automation without compromising your privacy or content.

So whether you're automating content creation, building smart assistants, or streamlining research workflows, Chrome Workflows adapts to your needs. Try it today and experience the future of browser automation.

Thanks for watching!
