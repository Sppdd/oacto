# Demo Script: Chrome AI + n8n Integration

---

Hi! I'm excited to introduce Chrome Workflows—a Chrome extension that turns any web page into an automation surface powered by n8n and Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI.

If you've tried to automate your web work, you know the pain: copy‑pasting into tools, switching tabs, risking sensitive data in the cloud, or maintaining brittle scripts. Chrome Workflows fixes this with one simple idea: trigger smart, reliable automations right where the content lives—your browser—no servers required.

Because it uses Chrome’s on‑device AI, your browser can understand, transform, translate, and generate text with real intelligence—without leaving the page. That means faster results, fewer moving parts, and automations that actually understand context.

Privacy is built-in. Your data stays local to Chrome. No round trips, no third‑party collection. It’s ideal for sensitive research, internal docs, or customer data you simply can’t send elsewhere.

Here’s the flow. Right‑click on any page, select a workflow, and run it. The extension captures just what’s needed, sends it to your n8n workflow, and the result comes back instantly—summaries, rewrites, translations, or structured outputs—without breaking your reading flow.

Let’s try it on this article. With one click, the workflow analyzes the content, extracts what matters, and returns a clean, usable result. No copying, no juggling apps, and no lost focus—just reliable, in‑place automation.

You’re in control. Choose from seven AI capabilities—Prompt AI, Writer, Summarizer, Translator, Rewriter, Proofreader, and Language Detector—tune parameters like temperature or tone, manage multiple workflows in the dashboard, and configure origin‑trial tokens for advanced features when needed.

I built Chrome Workflows because automation should be private, fast, and usable by anyone—not just developers. By combining n8n’s power with Chrome’s native AI, you get sophisticated, practical automation that respects your time and your data.

Ready to work smarter? Install the extension, open the web app at http://localhost:3333, and right‑click to run your first AI‑powered workflow. Try Chrome Workflows today.

Thanks for watching!
