## N8n workflows powered by Chrome AI APIs

All what you need to do is to drag and drop or use the import file on the top right menu and select the Json file to a N8n canvas to run them. 

These workflows are the same once that been showcased in the demo.

I recommend starting with the [Chat with Chrome Prompt AI workflow](./Chat%20with%20Chrome%20Prompt%20AI.json), because doesn't need any crendentials to setup.
